# Multi-Product Cross-Platform Monorepo — Philosophy

> **What this document is.** The architecture, the locked decisions, and the _why_ behind
> them — the enduring rationale for the whole monorepo. It is the **gospel**: while the
> template is being built, the implementing agent follows it literally and never contradicts
> it; whenever a foundational question comes up later ("why is it this way / can we change
> X"), this is the authority. It is **not** a daily-development doc — once the monorepo
> exists, the day-to-day loop (add-a-feature, add-a-component, release) runs off the
> `CLAUDE.md` files and the slash commands, which distill these decisions into operational
> recipes. Change a decision here only deliberately, and propagate it into the affected
> `CLAUDE.md`/guides in the same change.

> **Naming conventions:** package scope `@platform/*`; bundle ids `com.example.*`
> (placeholder until a real reverse-domain is chosen); infra names follow
> `<org>-<product>-<env>` (org placeholder `example`); products are `template` (the
> working template at `products/_template`) + `demo` (stamped proof). Product names —
> never the monorepo's name — drive all app ids, slugs, and infra naming, so the scaffold
> stays portable and products stay independently brandable. Keep placeholders
> (`example`, `com.example.*`, `TODO-EAS-PROJECT-ID`, releases-repo owner) clearly
> marked; swap them for real org values when infra accounts exist.

## Context

This work scaffolds a **platform/template monorepo** hosting multiple independent
cross-platform mini-products. Each product ships to iOS, Android, web, and desktop from
**one shared UI codebase**, backed by its own FastAPI service and fully segregated infra
(own Fly apps, Supabase projects per env, Vercel project, EAS project, Electron identity)
— all in one org. New products are stamped from `products/_template` by a generator
script.

Goal of this build: `products/_template` working end-to-end on all 4 targets — shared
design system (light/dark, per-product brandable), auth, an API-backed items list through
the OpenAPI→TS type-gen pipeline, realtime invalidation, push loop, observability — then
stamp one `demo` product to prove the generator.

## Decision Sheet

- **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces + Turborepo 2.9 (`--affected`); mise pins **Node 24 LTS** / **pnpm 11** / Python 3.13 / uv. **pnpm 11 config note:** settings relocate out of `.npmrc` into `pnpm-workspace.yaml` as camelCase keys (`nodeLinker: hoisted`, `preferFrozenLockfile: true`); `.npmrc` is auth/registry-only; `only-built-dependencies` is removed → use the `allowBuilds` map (pnpm 11 requires Node ≥ 22.13, satisfied by 24)
- **Frontend:** Expo SDK 56 (RN 0.85, React 19.2, New Arch mandatory, Hermes v1) + react-native-web, managed + EAS; **NativeWind v4** (v5 is pre-release — do NOT use) on **Tailwind CSS v3** (NOT v4 — v4's CSS-first config belongs to NativeWind v5); Expo Router; **TanStack Query v5 + Zustand v5**; per-platform overrides via `.ios/.android/.web/.native` extensions. **NativeWind-v4 ↔ SDK 56 is unverified by an official pairing (last on-record official pairing is SDK 54); the safe-harbor fallback is SDK 54, NOT 55. Policy: start on 56, fall back to 54 only if it proves unworkable — do not downgrade preemptively.** **SDK 56 routes global `fetch` through `expo/fetch`** (affects the generated client transport + Sentry network breadcrumbs; escape hatch `EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_RN_FETCH=1`). **EAS Update requires `updates.url` (`https://u.expo.dev/<projectId>`) + a `runtimeVersion` policy in `app.config.ts`** (projectId alone won't deliver OTA)
- **Design system:** **react-native-reusables** (now `founded-labs/react-native-reusables`; run the CLI on the **NativeWind** path, NOT Uniwind/CSS-first) adopted INTO `packages/ui` (shadcn model: components are copied in and OWNED, not a black-box dep); cva variants + `className` escape hatch; **semantic CSS-variable tokens** (`--background`, `--primary`, …) with **light+dark from day 1** (runtime-switchable); per-product branding = each product overrides token VALUES, never component code. `@rn-primitives/*` are now at **1.4.x** (NOT pre-1.0) — still pinned exact, but the rationale is **version-coupling to react-native-reusables**, not pre-1.0 instability
- **Code sharing:** `packages/core` = plumbing only (supabase client factory, auth session store + route guards, query client **with cache persistence** — AsyncStorage native / localStorage web —, env, Sentry init); features are **product-local** (`app/features/<feature>/`, route files stay thin one-liners); **promote to `packages/*` on 2nd use** (documented convention)
- **Template lifecycle:** stamped products are **snapshots** — divergence accepted, template kept thin, reusables pushed down into `packages/*`; shared packages **co-evolve** (`workspace:*`, breaking change = fix all consumers in same PR, CI `--affected` enforces); `_template` app is a **rich starter**: auth screens (login/signup on core plumbing), API-backed list screen, settings with theme/dark toggle, tab navigation
- **Desktop:** Electron bundling the exported Expo web build; electron-builder + electron-updater (GitHub Releases)
- **Backend (per product):** FastAPI (Pydantic v2), uv + Ruff, SQLModel + Alembic, Dockerized → Fly.io (staging + production apps)
- **Topology (hybrid):** core data via FastAPI → Supabase Postgres (pooler 6543); Supabase Auth (FastAPI verifies JWTs); `supabase-js` on frontend ONLY for auth/Realtime/Storage uploads
- **Contracts:** FastAPI OpenAPI → `@hey-api/openapi-ts` (pinned exact, pre-1.0; ~0.98.x) + TanStack Query plugin (`@tanstack/react-query`); generated client committed per product. **Do NOT install `@hey-api/client-fetch` as a dependency** — since openapi-ts 0.73 the fetch client is bundled inside `@hey-api/openapi-ts`; `@hey-api/client-fetch` is valid ONLY as a **plugin identifier** in the `plugins` array. Client configured via `setConfig({ baseUrl })` + `interceptors.request.use(...)`
- **Hosting:** web → Vercel (one project/product, turbo-ignore); per-env separate Supabase projects; local dev via Supabase CLI stack
- **Quality:** ESLint flat config + Prettier; Ruff; **pyright strict** + Pydantic strict mode (Python); **single Jest runner** (jest-expo preset) + RNTL for ALL JS tests; Playwright (web E2E, **nightly CI**); Maestro (mobile E2E, **local-only initially**); pytest + httpx against **real Postgres**; typegen drift check; GitHub Actions (affected-only) — full inventory in “Testing strategy”
- **Cross-cutting:** Sentry (`@sentry/react-native` — NOT deprecated `sentry-expo`; the **Expo config plugin is `@sentry/react-native/expo`** + Metro `getSentryExpoConfig` wiring for production source maps; pin a release that lists SDK 56 / RN 0.85 support), Expo Push, Supabase Storage/CDN
- **Multi-product:** `products/<name>/` consuming shared `packages/{ui,core,config}`; `pnpm new-product <name>` generator; infra naming `<org>-<product>-<env>`
- **Git hooks (Lefthook, repo-level + affected-scoped):** `lefthook.yml` at root. **pre-commit** (fast, staged files only): Prettier + ESLint on staged JS/TS, Ruff check+format on staged `.py` (scoped to the touched product's api). **pre-push:** `turbo run typecheck test build --affected` + (for affected APIs) pyright strict + pytest — i.e. ONLY the product(s) actually touched run (plus all dependents when `packages/*` change, which is the co-evolve guard moved before the push). Builds are turbo-cached so repeat pushes are fast
- **Design system workbench:** **Storybook 9 (9.1.x)** (web, **`@storybook/react-native-web-vite`** — renders the SAME RN components through react-native-web that ship to every target; NOT on-device `@storybook/react-native`; chose 9 over ESM-only 10 for the broadest RN-web-vite + NativeWind compat) as a SINGLE shared workbench in `packages/ui` — `.storybook/main.ts` sets `jsxImportSource: "nativewind"` and runs the Tailwind/NativeWind step on `global.css`; the framework already aliases `react-native`→`react-native-web` (no manual alias needed) — stories colocated (`*.stories.tsx`, one story per cva variant), run with `pnpm --filter @platform/ui storybook`. Global decorator imports `global.css` + wraps in the theme provider so `className`/NativeWind utilities resolve identically to the app; toolbar exposes a **light/dark toggle AND a brand switcher** (template ↔ demo) that swaps the active CSS-var set — so the workbench is also the live preview surface for the Figma token modes (below) and the demo-able "one component set, different brand" moment. Visual regression = Playwright screenshots of the static Storybook build (iterates the stories `index.json`, each story × {light,dark}), committed baselines, wired into the nightly E2E run. **Chromatic deliberately declined** — self-hosted Playwright keeps VR free + in-repo, consistent with the no-paid-SaaS stance elsewhere
- **Component lifecycle (shadcn-ownership two-tier):** Tier-1 **owned primitives** in `packages/ui/src/components/ui/` (react-native-reusables components copied in via its CLI, then OWNED as source); Tier-2 **product compositions** start product-local in `app/features/<feature>/components/` and **promote down into `packages/ui` on 2nd use**. Primitives consume **semantic tokens ONLY** (`bg-primary`, never hex/brand values) so one set works on all targets + all products. Fixed **add-a-component recipe** (documented in `packages/ui` CLAUDE.md, enforced like the API's `model→service→schema→router`): `cli-add (or author) → pin @rn-primitives/* exact → write *.stories.tsx (one per variant) → write *.figma.tsx Code Connect map → export from index.ts → commit VR baseline (light+dark)`. Exposed as a `/add-component` command
- **Figma bridge (design ↔ code, three planes):** (1) **Tokens** — a Figma Variables file is the source of truth for token VALUES: `primitives` collection (raw scale) + `semantic` collection (`--primary`, `--background`, `--muted`, …) whose **modes = light/dark × brand (template/demo)**, mapping 1:1 onto each product's `theme.ts`/`global.css`. A token-export script (`figma-tokens.mjs`, **source abstracted behind one interface — default Tokens Studio JSON export (tier-independent, CI-runnable, reviewable diff); Figma REST Variables API on Enterprise plans** — → Style Dictionary) regenerates the CSS-var values per product — a brand change in Figma rebrands a product with ZERO component edits, the design-side mirror of the locked theming mechanism. Pin **Style Dictionary v5** (ESM-only, DTCG) and actually run it — a custom HSL-channel transform feeding `hsl(var(--x))` plus `css/variables` + a JS format co-generate `global.css` (web) AND native `theme.ts`. (2) **Components** — **Code Connect** `*.figma.tsx` files colocated next to each `packages/ui` component map Figma component props → cva variants, so `get_design_context` returns real `@platform/ui` components, not generic JSX. **Code Connect's CLI config MUST be `figma.config.json` at the repo ROOT** (next to `package.json`) — a `.figma/` subdir is NOT discovered; the token-pipeline config is named separately (`tokens.config.json`) to avoid a filename collision. The **Code Connect CLI reads `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`** (scopes `code_connect:write` + `file_content:read`) — distinct from the REST Variables pull's `FIGMA_TOKEN`/`X-Figma-Token` (which stays Enterprise-only). (3) **Screens** — with (1)+(2) wired, scaffolding a `features/<x>` screen from a Figma frame yields on-system code (owned components + semantic tokens, no one-off hex). Figma official MCP server drives all three. **Library is GLOBAL** (`packages/ui` + shared Foundations) — per-app differentiation is a brand _mode_, never a forked component library. Handover-day bootstrap is a documented, repeatable procedure (`/bootstrap-design-system`, see gotchas); designer conventions live in `packages/ui/FIGMA.md`
- **API hardening (template defaults):** env-driven **CORS allowlist** (web origin + `app://` desktop + mobile), security-headers middleware, **slowapi** rate limiting (per-IP + per-user) — every product inherits sensible defaults
- **Branding assets:** template ships placeholder icon/splash/favicon in `app/assets/brand/` from a single source; a regen script (`gen-brand.mjs`, using **`sharp`**) produces all sizes; the generator copies them and prints a "replace brand assets" checklist item
- **Background/scheduled jobs:** **Fly scheduled machines** running a lightweight `tasks` module in the api (no queue infra); template ships one example (prune stale push tokens); heavier products can add a worker later
- **Operational defaults:** per-product `seed.py` (local dev data) + **polyfactory** test factories; API versioning = additive-only within `/v1`, new prefix for breaking changes; template app ships a global **error boundary + offline/error UX**; root `pnpm bootstrap` (mise → install → supabase start) for one-command onboarding; `.env.example` documents every consumed var
- **Env/config:** frontend config is publishable-only (`EXPO_PUBLIC_*`) in **committed per-env files** (`.env.development/.staging/.production` in each product's `app/`; gitignore allows these, still ignores `.env` + `.env.local`); EAS profiles / Vercel envs select them. Secrets live in **each platform's native store** (Fly secrets, EAS env, Vercel env, GH Actions) — setup codified in the generator checklist
- **Releases:** trunk-based — `main` → staging auto (API deploy + web previews + **EAS Update OTA to staging channel**); tag `<product>-<surface>-v*` → that product's production (surface = api/app/desktop); mobile = **OTA for JS-only changes**, store builds only when native deps change
- **DB conventions (template defaults):** **UUIDv7 PKs** (SQLModel base model) — generated via the maintained **`uuid-utils`** (`from uuid_utils import uuid7`) or `uuid6`, pinned exact (**app-side generation — PG-version-independent; deliberately NOT Postgres-native `uuidv7()`**, so the template runs on any Supabase Postgres); NOT the unmaintained `uuid7` PyPI package, and stdlib `uuid.uuid7` only lands in Python 3.14. **`DELETE`/`UPDATE` go through `session.execute(delete(...))`, never `session.exec(...)`** (SQLModel `exec()` only types `select()` — `delete()`/`update()` break pyright strict and don't expose `.rowcount`); **RLS deny-all on every table** via the template's initial migration (the API's privileged role bypasses it; PostgREST/Realtime surface locked, opened per-table only where Realtime reads are wanted); schema changes ONLY via Alembic
- **API conventions / architecture (template defaults):** strict **layered OOP** — `schemas/` (Pydantic v2 DTOs = the API contract) ↔ `routers/` (thin, depend on a service, map schema↔domain) → `services/` (class per aggregate, holds the session via `Depends`, owns business logic AND data access) → `models/` (SQLModel tables, persistence only). **No repository layer** — service classes query directly (kept deliberately lean for CRUD-thin products). **DTOs are always separate from DB models — ORM models are never serialized to the client.** **RFC 9457 problem+json** errors (typed into OpenAPI → typed client); **cursor pagination** (`useInfiniteQuery`-ready); template ships `hello` + `me` + `items` CRUD in this exact shape. **Type strictness: pyright strict mode + Pydantic strict mode, enforced in pre-push AND CI** (no untyped defs, no implicit `Any`). Pragmatic layering — no full-DDD entities/value-objects/events (revisit only if a product needs it)
- **Realtime (canonical pattern): broadcast-only** — tables stay RLS-locked; after mutations FastAPI broadcasts invalidation events on per-product channels (service-role HTTP call); clients refetch through the API. `packages/core` ships the subscribe-and-invalidate helper (wires channel events → TanStack invalidation). No Postgres-Changes subscriptions, no RLS holes, schema stays private
- **Push notifications: full loop templated** — token registration in the app (expo-notifications), `/v1/push-tokens` endpoint + table (per user+device), `send_push()` service calling Expo's Push API via httpx
- **Observability:** Sentry + **structlog JSON logs** + `request_id` middleware in FastAPI; the API-client wrapper sends a generated `X-Request-Id` per request; Sentry events tagged with it on both sides → client→API→logs traceability
- **Docs & agent surface:** README.md + **CLAUDE.md** + **slash commands** (`.claude/commands/`) at THREE levels — monorepo root, the shared **`packages/ui` design system**, AND inside every product (product-level authored once in `products/_template`, token-rewritten by the generator). Root CLAUDE.md = monorepo map + conventions (promote-on-2nd-use, naming, theming mechanism, **semantic-tokens-only**, **Figma-modes-are-brand-modes**, broadcast-only realtime, problem+json, never-edit-generated-client) + gotchas (hoisted linker, pooler ports). **`packages/ui/CLAUDE.md` = the design-system runbook and the symmetric counterpart to the api CLAUDE.md** — the **add-a-component recipe** (cli-add/author → pin `@rn-primitives/*` exact → `*.stories.tsx` per variant → `*.figma.tsx` Code Connect map → export from `index.ts` → commit VR baseline), the two-tier ownership + promote-on-2nd-use rule, the **never-name-a-color / tokens-only** invariant, how to run Storybook + the brand/theme toolbar, authoring Code Connect, the Figma token-sync flow (`/sync-tokens` → `figma-tokens.mjs`, never hand-edit generated `theme.ts`), and the handover-day **`/bootstrap-design-system`** procedure (reconcile → tokens → components → verify). Designer-facing **`packages/ui/FIGMA.md`** holds the Figma library conventions (Variables structure, modes=theme×brand, names-as-API, component anatomy matches code, publish as a team library) — the single doc handed to the design team. The api CLAUDE.md (nested under each product) = the add-an-endpoint-end-to-end recipe (model→service→schema→router→openapi→typegen→hook→screen) + the strict-OOP/strict-typing/DTO-separation rules. Product CLAUDE.md = product structure, ports, infra names, where compositions live (`features/<x>/components/`) + the promote trigger + that the product's `theme.ts` is the export of its Figma brand mode. READMEs (root + product) carry the human quickstart (where components live, launch the workbench, sync tokens) and point at the CLAUDE.md for the authoritative recipe rather than duplicating it. Root commands take a product arg (`/new-product`, `/affected`, `/typegen <product>`, `/release <product> <surface>`) except `/add-component <name>` (operates on shared `packages/ui`: runs the add-a-component recipe — cli-add, story, Code Connect map, export, baseline), `/sync-tokens` (runs `figma-tokens.mjs`), and `/bootstrap-design-system` (handover-day import); product commands are product-scoped (`/dev`, `/typegen`, `/migrate`, `/add-feature`, `/release <surface>`) and apply when a session opens in the product dir (CLAUDE.md loads hierarchically; commands load from the session's project root). Decision-record format (ADRs vs ARCHITECTURE.md) **deferred**

## Key design rulings

1. **ONE Expo app per product** (`products/<name>/app`) serves iOS + Android + web — no
   separate `web/` workspace. Web deploy = `expo export --platform web` → `dist/` → Vercel.
   Desktop wraps that same `dist/`. A product = 3 workspaces (`app`, `desktop`, `api`) +
   generated `api-client`.
2. **Electron routing:** Expo Router has no hash mode and breaks under `file://`. Use a
   privileged **custom `app://` protocol** in main process serving `dist/` with SPA
   fallback to `index.html` (history-API routing + absolute assets + offline all work).
   Requires `web.output: "single"` (SPA) in `app.config.ts`.
3. **electron-updater collision:** GitHub provider resolves "latest release of the repo" —
   multiple products in one monorepo collide. Each product's desktop publishes to its own
   `<org>/<product>-desktop-releases` repo (placeholder until real org/repo exists).
4. **Supabase pooler reality:** Supavisor **deprecated session mode on the 6543 pooler
   (2025-02-28)** — 6543 is transaction-mode only (session mode and direct connections live
   on **5432**); asyncpg prepared statements break on the transaction pooler. Use **psycopg
   v3** + `prepare_threshold=None` + `NullPool`. **Alembic migrates over direct port 5432**
   via separate `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL`, run as Fly release command.
5. **JWT verify:** new Supabase projects (created after 2025-10-01) **default to asymmetric
   ES256** → verify via JWKS (`PyJWKClient`, ES256/RS256, cached) as the **primary path on
   ALL environments**. The **local CLI now ALSO issues ES256 by default** (since CLI
   v2.71.1) — so point `SUPABASE_URL` at `http://localhost:54321` and let `PyJWKClient` hit
   the local `/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json` locally too. HS256 + `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` is
   kept as a **genuine fallback only** (older CLI, self-hosted symmetric secret,
   manually-minted test tokens) — it is NO LONGER the local happy path. (A backend that
   trusts only HS256 locally will 401 every request on a current CLI — supabase/cli#4726.)
6. **pnpm + Expo:** `nodeLinker: hoisted` in **`pnpm-workspace.yaml`** (pnpm 11 — this
   setting moved out of `.npmrc`; the hoisted linker is still the documented Expo happy
   path); explicit `watchFolders`/`nodeModulesPaths` in metro config; never set
   `disableHierarchicalLookups`.
7. **Template is a working product:** `products/_template` matches workspace globs and
   builds in CI so it never rots. It uses the literal product name `template`; the
   generator whole-word-replaces `template` (kebab/Pascal/snake variants) in contents AND
   paths.
8. **Theming mechanism is CSS variables, not tailwind values:** the shared tailwind
   preset maps semantic color names to vars (`primary: "hsl(var(--primary))"`, …);
   `packages/ui` ships the default light/dark theme blocks (CSS vars on web, NativeWind
   `vars()` objects on native); each product overrides variable VALUES in its own theme
   file/global.css. One set of components, per-product brand, runtime dark mode — and the
   identical mechanism on all four targets.
9. **Rich-starter inheritance instead of shared screens:** auth/login screens live in the
   template's `app/features/auth/` (product-local), so every stamped product COPIES a
   working auth UI it can freely restyle — reuse without coupling products to a shared
   screens package. Only auth plumbing (session store, guards) is shared via
   `packages/core`.
10. **Backend is strict layered OOP, but Pythonic:** service classes model real cohesion
    (each holds the session, owns its aggregate's business logic + data access); they are
    NOT one-method wrappers or staticmethod buckets. The fixed per-feature recipe is
    `model → service → schema → router` — this is the contract documented in the api
    CLAUDE.md and the thing AI agents follow verbatim. No repository layer (services query
    directly); DTOs (`schemas/`) are the ONLY thing crossing the HTTP boundary, SQLModel
    tables never are. Avoid full-DDD ceremony unless a product earns it.
11. **Figma modes ARE the per-product brand modes:** the locked code-side theming
    mechanism (semantic CSS vars, per-product = override values) has an exact Figma-side
    mirror — a `semantic` Variables collection whose modes are light/dark × brand. So Figma
    is not bolted on; each product's `theme.ts` is the export of one Figma brand mode, and
    the Storybook brand switcher previews those same modes. One token contract spans design,
    workbench, and all four runtime targets. The token-export script is one-directional
    (Figma → code, committed) to keep generated theme files reviewable; Code Connect maps
    are the only design artifacts that live in-repo as source (`*.figma.tsx`).

## Package management model

One repo, **one JS dependency universe + N isolated Python universes**, all orchestrated
by one Turborepo task graph:

| Layer    | Management                                                                                                                                      | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| JS/TS    | **Global** — root pnpm workspace, ONE `pnpm-lock.yaml`, hoisted `node_modules`, single `pnpm install`                                           | Products share LIVE code (`@platform/ui`, `@platform/core` via `workspace:*`) — they must resolve against one dependency graph or shared packages break. Each workspace still declares its own deps in its own `package.json` (products MAY pin divergent versions of a lib; pnpm dedupes in the single lockfile) |
| Python   | **Per-product** — each `products/<name>/api` is a self-contained uv project: own `pyproject.toml`, own `uv.lock`, own `.venv`, own Docker image | Product APIs share NOTHING; isolation is the feature — a dep bump in one API cannot ripple into another, and each deploys independently. The `package.json` in `api/` is only a script shim so Turborepo can orchestrate `uv run` tasks in the same graph                                                         |
| Supabase | **Per-product** — own `config.toml`, own migrations, own local stack on offset ports                                                            | Full data-plane segregation per product                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Corollary (document in root CLAUDE.md): there is deliberately **no shared Python
package** between products. Cross-product reuse happens in TypeScript (`packages/*`) or
by improving `_template` for future products — if Python reuse pressure ever gets real,
that's a new architecture decision, not a default.

## Config essentials & gotchas

**turbo.json (2.9 `tasks`):** `openapi` (api pkgs; `inputs: ["src/**/*.py","pyproject.toml","uv.lock"]`,
`outputs: ["openapi.json"]`) → `api-client#build` runs openapi-ts (`dependsOn: ["^openapi","^build"]`
via package-level turbo.json) → app `build`/`export:web` (`dependsOn: ["^build"]`) →
`desktop#build` (`dependsOn: ["^export:web"]`, copies `../app/dist` → `renderer/`). `dev` =
`cache:false, persistent`. Dependency edges come from real `dependencies`/`devDependencies`
(`api-client` devDepends on its `api`; `desktop` devDepends on its `app`). Python `inputs`
globs are mandatory or caching is wrong.

**metro.config.js (template app):**

```js
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);
config.watchFolders = [workspaceRoot]; // ../../..
config.resolver.nodeModulesPaths = [projectRoot + "/node_modules", workspaceRoot + "/node_modules"];
module.exports = withNativeWind(config, { input: "./global.css" });
```

**babel.config.js:** `[["babel-preset-expo",{jsxImportSource:"nativewind"}],"nativewind/babel"]`.
**tailwind.config.js:** presets `@platform/config/tailwind-preset`; content = app globs +
`path.dirname(require.resolve("@platform/ui/package.json")) + "/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"`
(robust cross-package globs; `packages/ui` has NO tailwind config of its own).
**Theming wiring:** the preset maps semantic colors to CSS vars
(`primary: "hsl(var(--primary))"`, `background`, `foreground`, `muted`, `border`, …);
`packages/ui/src/lib/theme.ts` exports default light/dark values (react-native-reusables
convention) — web gets them as `:root`/`.dark` blocks in `global.css`, native via
NativeWind `vars()` in the theme provider. A product rebrands by overriding variable
values in its own `theme.ts`/`global.css`; component code is never forked. Pin
react-native-reusables' `@rn-primitives/*` deps exactly (now 1.4.x — pinned for
version-coupling to rn-reusables, not pre-1.0).

**Electron main.ts essentials:** `protocol.registerSchemesAsPrivileged([{scheme:"app",
privileges:{standard:true,secure:true,supportFetchAPI:true}}])`; `protocol.handle("app", ...)`
maps URL path → file under `renderer/`, falling back to `index.html` when missing/dir;
`win.loadURL("app://-/")`; `autoUpdater.checkForUpdatesAndNotify()`. macOS auto-update
needs signing/notarization — gate publish to win/linux until certs exist.

**api/db.py:** `create_engine(url, poolclass=NullPool, connect_args={"prepare_threshold": None})`
(psycopg3, pooler 6543). **auth.py:** JWKS via `PyJWKClient` (cached), `audience="authenticated"`,
algs ES256/RS256 — **JWKS is the primary path locally too** (point `SUPABASE_URL` at
`http://localhost:54321`; current CLI issues ES256). HS256 is a genuine fallback only (older
CLI / self-hosted / minted test tokens), NOT the local default. Expose `CurrentUser` dependency.
**export_openapi.py:** writes `app.openapi()` JSON, sorted keys (stable diffs), no server needed.
**Dockerfile:** multi-stage `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv` (`uv sync --frozen --no-dev` → slim runtime).
Python deps: fastapi, uvicorn[standard], pydantic-settings, sqlmodel,
sqlalchemy[postgresql-psycopg], psycopg[binary], alembic, pyjwt[crypto], httpx,
sentry-sdk[fastapi], structlog, slowapi; dev: pytest, ruff, pyright, polyfactory.

**Typegen:** `@hey-api/openapi-ts` pinned exact (~0.98.x; fetch client now bundled in — do
NOT add `@hey-api/client-fetch` as a dep, use it only as a `plugins` identifier) + TanStack Query
plugin (generates `queryOptions`/typed SDK — beats openapi-typescript+openapi-fetch which
needs hand-written glue). Output committed; CI drift check:
`turbo run openapi build --filter=*api-client* && git diff --exit-code products/*/api-client products/*/api/openapi.json`.
App sets client baseUrl from `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` at startup.

**Storybook (`packages/ui/.storybook`):** framework `@storybook/react-native-web-vite`;
`main.ts` stories glob `../src/**/*.stories.tsx`; Vite config aliases `react-native` →
`react-native-web` and runs the NativeWind/Tailwind step on `global.css`. `preview.tsx`
imports `global.css`, wraps every story in the theme provider via a global decorator, and
declares two toolbar `globalTypes` — `theme` (light|dark, toggles the `.dark` class) and
`brand` (template|demo, swaps the active CSS-var block). Stories enumerate cva variants
(argTypes can be derived from the cva config). VR: `storybook build` → `storybook-static/`;
Playwright reads `storybook-static/index.json`, visits `iframe.html?id=<story>&globals=theme:dark`
(and `:light`) per story, diffs committed baselines — runs in `e2e-nightly.yml`.

**Figma bridge:** `scripts/figma-tokens.mjs` pulls Variables via the Figma REST API
(`GET /v1/files/:key/variables/local`, needs `FIGMA_TOKEN`), resolves the `semantic`
collection's modes through Style Dictionary, and writes each product's `theme.ts`/`global.css`
CSS-var values — one-way + committed (drift is review-visible, optional CI re-run + `git diff
--exit-code` guard like typegen). `figma.config.json` maps `{ fileKey, modes: { "template":
<modeId>, "demo": <modeId> } }`. Code Connect: colocated `*.figma.tsx` map Figma component
props → cva variants; published via the Code Connect CLI (`.figma/` config) so MCP
`get_design_context` returns owned `@platform/ui` components. The generator adds the new
product's brand mode to `figma.config.json` (placeholder modeId until the designer creates it).

**Bootstrap the design system from Figma (`/bootstrap-design-system`, handover-day, one-time
then incremental):** the procedure that turns a handed-over **published Figma team library**
(two libraries: **Foundations** = Variables; **Components** = component sets) into the wired
`packages/ui` style system — **tokens first, components second** (components can't be built
before the token system they consume exists). **Step 0 — connect + inventory + reconcile:**
read access (MCP Dev Mode or `FIGMA_TOKEN`); pull the **token manifest** (`get_variable_defs`/
REST dump → collections, modes, names, types) and **component manifest** (`get_metadata` over
the Components page → component sets + their component-property/variant schemas); reconcile
against `FIGMA.md` conventions (flag raw-hex fills not bound to variables, modes not mapping
to light/dark/brand, non-code-friendly variant values) and resolve with design BEFORE
importing. **Step 1 — establish tokens (keystone):** fix the canonical CSS-var contract
(shadcn/rn-reusables semantic set), map Figma semantic variables → those names in
`figma.config.json`, run `figma-tokens.mjs` → `packages/ui` default `theme.ts` + `global.css`
(preset already maps semantic names → `hsl(var(--x))`). **Step 2 — establish components
(mirror onto owned source):** walk the component manifest in dependency order (Text →
Button/Input/Card → composites); per component run the add-a-component recipe (rn-reusables
`cli-add` aligned to the Figma variants, or author bespoke), accelerated by `get_design_context`

- `get_code_connect_suggestions`, refined into the owned shadcn shape; publish Code Connect
  maps. **Step 3 — verify on all four targets:** Storybook full gallery + brand/theme toolbar;
  `_template` app themed on web/native/desktop; commit VR baselines; **prove the live bind** —
  change one Figma token → `/sync-tokens` → everything re-themes. Steady state after bootstrap:
  `/sync-tokens` on token changes, `/add-component` for new components, new product brand = a new
  mode export. Tokens are fully automated; the component mirror is assisted, not one-click.

**Generator (`scripts/new-product.mjs`, plain Node):**

1. Validate `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$/`, refuse collisions; `portIndex` = max+1.
2. Copy `_template` → `products/<name>` (skip node_modules/.venv/dist/.expo/release; keep uv.lock).
3. Whole-word replace `template`/`Template`/`template_api` in contents AND paths → kebab/Pascal/snake variants (covers package names, slug/scheme/bundle ids, electron appId + releases repo, fly app names, pyproject module, alembic, supabase project_id, and the product's README.md / CLAUDE.md / `.claude/commands/*` — ports and infra names in those docs come from `product.json` so they stay accurate).
4. Ports from portIndex: API `8000+10i`; Supabase block `54321+100i` → products' local stacks coexist. Applied everywhere ports appear: supabase `config.toml`, api dev script, AND the committed `app/.env.*` files (`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`, supabase URL).
5. Write `.env.example` + `product.json`; `pnpm install`.
6. Print infra checklist: 2 Supabase projects (`<org>-<name>-stg|prod`), `fly apps create <org>-<name>-api-stg|prod` + secrets, Vercel project (root `products/<name>/app`, build via turbo filter, output `dist`, ignore step `npx turbo-ignore`), `eas init` → paste projectId, create `<name>-desktop-releases` repo + `GH_TOKEN`, 4 Sentry projects + DSNs, per-product GH Action secrets.

**Workflows:** pin **current action majors** (June 2026): `actions/checkout@v6`,
`jdx/mise-action@v4`, `dorny/paths-filter@v4` (mise-action/paths-filter v4 are the Node-24
runtime bumps — Node 20 is EOL on GH runners), `expo/expo-github-action@v8` (current).
`ci.yml` — mise-action → pnpm frozen install → uv sync (affected apis) →
`turbo run lint typecheck test build openapi --affected` → drift check. Web: NO workflow
(Vercel git integration; `turbo-ignore` is now **optional** — Vercel ships a built-in
"skip unaffected monorepo builds" setting; if invoked bare, pass `--fallback=HEAD^` to avoid
the new-branch always-deploy gotcha). `deploy-api.yml` — paths-filter on
`products/*/api/** + packages/**` → matrix `flyctl deploy -c fly.staging.toml`; tags →
prod. `eas-build.yml` — dispatch/tag; needs `EXPO_TOKEN`, committed `.npmrc`,
`packageManager` field in root package.json (eas-cli workspace detection workaround).
`eas-update.yml` — OTA: on main push affecting a product's app → `eas update --channel
staging`; tag `<product>-ota-v*` → `--channel production` (store builds only for native
changes via `eas-build.yml`).
`electron-release.yml` — 3-OS matrix, `electron-builder --publish always`, tag must match
`desktop/package.json` version. All repo-specific values are clearly-marked placeholders
until the real repo/org exists.

Mocking conventions: frontend tests mock at the **generated-client boundary** (never
fetch); API unit tests mock external HTTP (Expo Push, Supabase broadcast) via httpx
mock transport — integration tests hit the real DB, never mock the session.

## Phases (each independently verifiable)

Built from the per-phase guides (removed at finalize; see git history).

Each phase = one commit (or a few logical commits) on a feature branch.

## Verification (end-to-end, after Phase 8)

1. `mise install && pnpm install && pnpm turbo run lint typecheck test build` — all green.
2. One shared `@platform/ui` component set visibly identical on: web (`localhost:8081`),
   device (Expo Go), desktop (Electron window) — all rendering data fetched from FastAPI
   via the generated TanStack hook, with the dark-mode toggle re-theming every target via
   the same CSS-variable mechanism, and the `demo` product showing different brand token
   values than `template` with unmodified component code.
3. Type-drift guard: edit a Pydantic response model → `turbo run openapi build` → committed
   client diff appears; skipping regen fails CI.
4. Multi-product proof: `_template` and `demo` dev stacks (Expo + API + Supabase local)
   running at the same time, distinct ports; `--affected` only rebuilds the touched product.
5. Naming audit: all app ids/slugs/infra names derive from product names (`template`,
   `demo`) with clearly marked `example` org placeholders — `git grep -inE 'example|TODO'`
   surfaces exactly the intended swap-points and nothing else.
